# Binary caches

To access the build results on other machines there are two options at the
moment

## Local binary cache (harmonia)

You can set up a binary cache on your buildbot-worker machine to make its nix
store accessible from other machines. Check out the README of the
[project](https://github.com/nix-community/harmonia/?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-for-public-binary-cache-on-nixos),
for an example configuration

## Cachix

Buildbot-nix also supports pushing packages to cachix. Check out the comment out
[example configuration](https://github.com/Mic92/buildbot-nix/blob/main/examples/master.nix)
in our repository.

## Attic

Buildbot-nix does not have native support for pushing packages to
[attic](https://github.com/zhaofengli/attic) yet. However it's possible to
integrate run a systemd service as described in
[this example configuration](../../examples/attic-watch-store.nix). The systemd
service watches for changes in the local buildbot-nix store and uploads the
contents to the attic cache.
